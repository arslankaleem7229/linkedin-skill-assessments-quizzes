In this case, option B has all the queries separated by commas, making it the correct choice. Option A has the correct queries, but they are separated by \"RETURN\" which is not correct syntax for multiquery. Option C has an additional \"AND\" before the second query which is also not correct syntax. Option D has each query separated by semicolons, which would execute them as separate queries, not as a multiquery block.",
