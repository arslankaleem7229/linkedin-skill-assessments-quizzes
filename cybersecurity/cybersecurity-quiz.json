Other MFA methods such as biometric authentication, OAUTH tokens, and authenticator apps are often considered more secure alternatives.\n[Reference](https://www.zdnet.com/article/fbi-warns-about-attacks-that-bypass-multi-factor-authentication-mfa/) `\"(...)All in all, MFA is still very effective at preventing most mass and automated attacks; however, users should be aware that there are ways to bypass some MFA solutions, such as those relying on SMS-based verification.\"`",
