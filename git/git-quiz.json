            "answer": "The current branch's HEAD is reset back five commits, then prior commits are squashed into a single commit.",
            "explanation": "**Explanation:**\n- `git reset --hard HEAD~5` resets the current branch to the commit just before the last 5 (see `man gitrevisions` for details about this notation and other cool alternatives like `HEAD@{2 days ago}`). As it is a hard reset, it will also overwrite every change in the working tree as well. See `man git-reset`.\n- `git merge --squash HEAD@{1}` HEAD@{1} is where the branch was just before the previous command (again, see `man gitrevisions`). This command sets the state of the index to be as it would just after a merge from that commit. This whole operation could be a way to take 5 commits from a branch in which you started a new feature and squash them to a single commit, a meaningful one.\n[Reference](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/70962338/documentation-of-default-target-of-git-merge-squash)",
