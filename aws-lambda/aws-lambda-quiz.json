But as you can see in the reference, Lambda's responsibility and method invocation can be categorized by Lambda polling and Event Driven (synchronous invocation). When you implement an event-driven architecture, you grant the event-generating service permission to invoke your function in the function's resource-based policy. Then you configure that service to generate events that invoke your function. When you implement a Lambda polling architecture, you grant Lambda permission to access the other service in the function's execution role. Lambda reads data from the other service, creates an event, and invokes your function. According to this analytics, Kinesis-DynamoDB-SQS use same method invocation, Lambda polling.`",

        "explanation": "**Explanation** (source google)\n- `With DynamoDB Streams, you can trigger a Lambda function to perform additional work each time a DynamoDB table is updated. Lambda reads records from the stream and invokes your function synchronously with an event that contains stream records.`\n- `These events are considered synchronous events. Simply put, it means that when somebody is calling an API Gateway, it will trigger your Lambda function. It's a synchronous event because your Lambda function has to respond to the client directly at the end of its invocation.`\n- `You can use Lambda to process event notifications from Amazon Simple Storage Service. Amazon S3 can send an event to a Lambda function when an object is created or deleted.`",

        "explanation": "**Explanation**\n- AWS Lambda charges are based on the number of requests (invocations) and the duration of time the code runs.

        "explanation": "**Explanation**\n- AWS Lambda allows a maximum execution timeout of 15 minutes for a single invocation. After 15 minutes, the function will be automatically terminated, even if the function's process is still running.

        "explanation": "**Explanation**\n- Amazon RDS (Relational Database Service) cannot directly trigger a Lambda function. RDS is a managed database service and does not have built-in functionality to trigger Lambda directly. However, other services like S3, DynamoDB Streams, and API Gateway can trigger Lambda functions when specific events occur (e.g., file uploads, data changes, API calls).",

        "explanation": "**Explanation**\n- `You would use CloudWatch to monitor memory-bound functions and create an alarm when memory consumption nears a preset limit.

A resource-based policy is attached to an AWS resource such as an Amazon Simple Storage Service (S3) bucket, a virtual private cloud (VPC) endpoint, AWS Key Management Service (KMS) encryption keys, and Amazon Simple Queueing Service (SQS) queues. Using a resource-based policy, you specify the principal who can access the resource and their permissible actions on the resource. A principal can be an account, user, role, or session principal. Session principals can be IAM federated users or role sessions. Policies are AWS objects that specify the permissions of an identity or a resource. You can choose an identity-based or resource-based policy when you create a permissions policy for restricted access to resources.`",
