This is useful for running a program or shell in a different root directory, which can be used for security, testing, or other purposes. When a process is `chroot`ed, it is isolated from the rest of the file system, and can only access files and directories within the new root directory.\nThe other options are not correct:\nb) Creating a new user account is done using the `useradd` or `adduser` commands.\nc) Displaying the current working directory is done using the `pwd` command.\nd) Changing file or directory permissions is done using the `chmod` command.",

These parameters control various aspects of the operating system, such as networking, memory management, and process scheduling. The `sysctl` command allows you to view the current values of these parameters, as well as modify them dynamically without the need to reboot the system.\nThe other options are not correct:\nb) Displaying information about running processes is done using the `ps` command.\nc) Managing user accounts and groups is done using commands like `useradd`, `groupadd`, and `usermod`.\nd) Managing network interfaces and routing is done using commands like `ip` and `route`.",
