            "explanation": "Es una buena práctica usar la palabra clave 'with' cuando se trata de objetos archivo. La ventaja es que el archivo se cierra correctamente después de que su suite termina, incluso si se lanza una excepción en algún punto. Usar with también es mucho más corto que escribir bloques try-finally equivalentes:\n**ejemplo**\n```python\n>>> f = open('workfile', 'w', encoding=\"utf-8\")\n>>> with open('workfile', encoding=\"utf-8\") as f:\nread_data = f.read()\n# Podemos verificar que el archivo se ha cerrado automáticamente.\n>>> f.closed\nTrue\n```\n[Referencia](https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/inputoutput.html#reading-and-writing-files)",
